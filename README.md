This project has a lot of potential. Before continuing the project there are couple of things to know and understand.
1)	The Engine in use is Ren’Py: You don’t have to make the game using Ren’Py engine. You can use unity or unreal engine.
2)	This game genre is based around a virtual novel. If you think this is not a better option, it can be changed into another genre. 
3)	Currently the file script.rpy is used to make new story narration. So, if a professor has to create new story for the class. He or she must go inside the script and copy paste the 
        story manually which is very inefficient. I would suggest creating a xml file where an old story file can be replaced by a new file, negating the possibility of manual input.
4)	Changing the history logs into activity logs and making it accessible from the game screen. These are some changes that are most for this game to grow.
Some of the points that can be add or changed for future work are as follows
Addition of 3 different stories at the beginning of the screen:

The game like cyberpunk was divided into 3 different stories. Although this game is a triple A title, it does set a great example of separating these 3 different worlds. DFG game doesn’t have to be complicated, but our game can also be separate into 3 different case stories, 
those are corporate case, civil case, and murder case. I think this kind of option can become a highlight for this game.
